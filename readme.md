## About

Why do we study *Algorithm Design* and *Data Structure*?

*Algorithms* are the foundation of all computing. Algorithms are the logic that get translated into computer codes for implementation. We can think of a computer as being a piece of hardware, with a hard drive, memory chips, processors, and so on. However, the essential component, the thing that, if missing, would render modern technology impossible, is the logic of Algorithms.

Essentially, Algorithm is the logic that allows us to manipulate data using computers. And in order for Algorithms to efficiently manipulate data, we organize the data using *Data Structures*. Thus, Algorithms and Data Structures often go hand-in-hand for computer programs to run smoothly.
